# PhD-Projects

A Hub and Central Mind-Thought-Idea Amalgamation Space for cool, new, and particularly wacky, and strange ideas in the worlds of computational and data science. Materials related to other fields may be included at undiscernable discretion.

This repository was made with PhD-oriented studies in mind, whether it be for current PhD students looking for research ideas for their thesis or anything in between, or a random undergraduate student, trying to figure out some semblance of their doctorate educational career (that's me). Regardless, feel free to use this however you like, whether it be to satisfy your curiosity, do some light research, or even contribute to building up this repository for other students and academics alike (Though in that case, reach out to me first, and maybe we can make some cool things for the people that use this)!
